add check before any action runs to ensure empty constructor exists for repo.


want to stop nuget adding references to project for all DLL's and exe in the nuget package.  only needs NHibernateRepo


try and get one base IRepo class - or update docs to reflect this change


need to get the powershell script to copy nhmigrate (the exe) to the repo folder before it runs, then clean up afterwards. (this is so NH can find the DLLs)

test from powershell

-----------------
EXE runner examples:

enable-migrations "E:\Work\nhibernateRepo\NHibernateRepository\Test\ExampleRepo\ExampleRepo.csproj" -repo examplerepo -configFile "E:\Work\nhibernateRepo\NHibernateRepository\Test\ExampleRepo\App.config" 
add-migration "E:\Work\nhibernateRepo\NHibernateRepository\Test\ExampleRepo\ExampleRepo.csproj" -repo examplerepo -configFile "E:\Work\nhibernateRepo\NHibernateRepository\Test\ExampleRepo\App.config" -filename add_mad_migration
update-database "E:\Work\nhibernateRepo\NHibernateRepository\Test\ExampleRepo\ExampleRepo.csproj" -repo examplerepo -confiGfile "E:\Work\nhibernateRepo\NHibernateRepository\Test\ExampleRepo\App.config" 

-----------------


nuget package to include nhmigrate and powershell scripts




Error checking and nice message to user that if they try and add a migration before a config is added they know why it failed.


make nhmigrate embed all the DLL's it uses => http://stackoverflow.com/questions/189549/embedding-dlls-in-a-compiled-executable

clean up and write explaination of test area, example project.

update readme to explain repocombined and repo split

update readme to include auto mapper settings info

update readme to explain that the project you point at for the model TEntity will find all classes and try and map them to the db, will only exlude some class types.

create powershell script to call exe with params

figure out how to get powershell to be first class citizen of PMC



do powershell stuff


ensure that paths can be relative, dont have to fully path.

make a migration completely transactional.  all executesql commands in one transaction.. probably do not use nhibernate at all at that point.


once all working and happy and committed => make another repo that is called naked or something... just exposes ISession, but allows to take advantage of migration stuff.  
Will need to think about how to do the setup stuff.  If it is all naked then they will need to config things are loaded from.. try and make it use the same setup process if possible.

----

(not in order yet)

figure out when powershell script is run how it knows which project to look in for repo stuff, does it get full file path?

be able to tell the schema creator which project to look in for Irepo implementation
run all instances of IRepo

when adding a migration should check that all previous migrations have already been run.



figure out how to run all scripts from IRepo

log when a file has been run

before a file is run check if it has already been executed.


Think about how to deal with Users wanting to include / exclude types in the configuration.
