# NHibernateRepository
Generic NHibernate Repository

The goal of this project is to provide a clean repository layer that tries to return sensible objects from the db entities.  It allows abstraction from a database or ORM and makes testing easier.

TODO:

Make a way of managing the database.  Want to imitate Entity Framework code first and migrations.
